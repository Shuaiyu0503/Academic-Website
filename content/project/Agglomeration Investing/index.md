abstract: 
#"Industrial agglomeration is a key determinant of firms' fundamentals. We show that some skilled mutual fund managers exploit the benefits of agglomeration of their holdings firms. Specifically, we propose a measure, agglomeration investing skill (AIS), to identify active funds that tilt their #portfolio weights to public firms whose headquarters are located in the agglomeration clusters. We find that funds in the top quintile of AIS significantly outperform those in the bottom quintile by 1.5 per year. Those high AIS funds tend to overweight multiple clusters with a long distance #from each other, suggesting that their outperformance is not due to informational advantages related to funds' geographical connections with the clusters. We also show that the industry concentration of funds' stock holdings cannot explain our results."
