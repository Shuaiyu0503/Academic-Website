abstract: 
#"A growing literature shows that managers can learn new information from stock prices to guide their investment and financing policies (feedback effects). However, there is little evidence on what managers learn from stock prices. This paper sheds light on this question by using cross-#border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as the empirical setting. We show that the probability of completing a cross-border M&A deal is positively associated with the acquirer's stock returns around the announcement of M&A plans. Furthermore, this positive relation increases with the #fraction of the acquirer's foreign institutional investors that are from the target's country. Our results suggest that an acquirer's manager learns from the acquirer's stock prices about the target's country-specific information, which is likely from institutional investors who have informational #advantages about the target country."
