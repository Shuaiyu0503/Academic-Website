abstract: "We study whether institutional investors affect media coverage of their portfolio firms through their ownership in media firms. We hypothesize that the blockholders of a publicly traded media outlet affect this media outlet’s coverage of their portfolio firms in their interests. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that a news outlet issues more positive articles covering the firms in its blockholders’ portfolios. In addition, the results are stronger when the covered firms have higher weights in the blockholders’ portfolios. Our results are robust when we fully control for firm fundamentals by exploiting within firm-quarter variation in media ownership and coverage, providing evidence that the effect is causal. Overall, our findings suggest that institutional investors influence media coverage through their media ownership."
