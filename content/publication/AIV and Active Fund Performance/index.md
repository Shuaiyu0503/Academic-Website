abstract: "This paper shows that aggregate idiosyncratic volatility (AIV) is a key determinant of active funds' ability to generate superior performance. Using the sample of active US equity mutual funds from 1984 through 2019, I find that AIV positively predicts benchmark-adjusted fund returns, and its predictive power is stronger for funds that deviate more from passive benchmarks. The predictability of AIV is also significant in the data of active international mutual funds. I then explore two non-mutually exclusive explanations for these findings: 1) active funds require a reward for accommodating exogenous asset demand and AIV drives their risk-bearing capacity (i.e., the risk view); and 2) they profit from private signals about firms' fundamentals and AIV proxies for aggregate flows of fundamental news (i.e., the information view). Additional empirical evidence supports the risk view. First, on average, active mutual funds scale back their active positions when AIV rises. Second, funds that do not reduce active positions earn larger abnormal returns following high AIV levels. Third, a large AIV shock leads to a temporary impact on stock prices. The observations during the COVID-19 crisis also corroborate the risk view."
